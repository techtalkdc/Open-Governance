### January 6th, 2017
1. What can we do to encourage organizer engagement?
  1. Topics are limited to language specific, section that is impacted by the topics, what’s useful in front-end development? 
  2. Sahil suggests that we focus talks towards one topic so that everyone - whether member or organizer - is incentivized to attend more often, (hopefully) helping people to take ownership and stay engaged on a more regular basis
  3. Sean suggests making a poll and curating our speakers to the interests of the members.
  4. All organizers have access to the twitter account?
    1.	Make sure that all of us can be responsible for what is said and what we follow/retweet.
2. Tech Series (Speakers Jan, Feb, March)
  1. Thinking of doing a series of talks instead of just standard talks
  2. No single person speaking who is an “expert,” more of a panel discussion
  3. More of a book club
  4. Alex Hoffman wanted to do a Javascript talk in February.
  5. Docker workshop/series
3. Workshops before the summer
  1. Workshops last year were in the summer, didn’t’ have a great turnout
  2. Make sure that we get the workshops out before summer for greater engagement.
  3. Consistency and focus of topics
4. Member engagement
  1. Putting together a draft for the poll of members and the topics that they would like to learn about.
    1. Example: http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016
  2. 13th and L meetup location? We can learn more about the preference of members for location change based on the poll.
  3. Sponsors
    1. Engage more companies, transparency of how its being organized?
    2. Public slack channel where we can discuss how the meetup is being organized?
5. Diversity
  1. Pat is doing research and is going to be reaching out to different members of the community to try and get speakers outside of our existing pool.
