* Session Title: Using Apache NiFi to Integrate Data into a NoSQL Multi-Model Database
* Preferred Timeframe: October 24th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Apache NiFi was built to automate the flow of data, providing a drag and drop, configurable user interface. With Apache NiFi, you can use out-of-the-box processors to create data flows from MySQL, Postgres, Apache Kafka, the Hadoop ecosystem, and many other data sources. If a processor doesn’t exist, you can build your own. You can also create templates for common data flow patterns, then publish and share them for collaboration needs.

Scott Fowler, MarkLogic Principal Sales Engineer, will discuss the value of integrating unstructured and structured data from multiple sources into an Operational Data Hub. This presentation will include a demonstration using Apache NiFi to ingest data into a MarkLogic NoSQL database.
