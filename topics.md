## Accepted Topics

###

* **Session Title**: Why you should use Kotlin
 * **Preferred Timeframe**: Evening, May 17 (Scheduled for May 22 with speaker approval)
 * **Event Type**: 30-min Lecture (I tend to give shorter talks—I'll happily split an evening meetup with another short presentation)
 * **Summary**: This talk will provide an overview of Kotlin, mostly as it compares to Java & Ruby.  Forum For All uses Kotlin in production for a growing portion of its API and Drew has written open source libraries for [link unfurling](https://github.com/dinomite/unfurling) and [interfacing with Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://github.com/dinomite/fcm-client) in Kotlin.

  Learn about Kotlin, a new language for the JVM.  Kotlin cleans up the worst parts of Java (checked exceptions, verbose syntax) and makes the functional programming constructs easy.

  Kotlin isn’t just for Android developers who are have to live in a hobbled JVM—it is Java updated for the modern world.  If you like static types but are frustrated by Java’s archaic syntax and lack of modern language conveniences, Kotlin is for you.

  Kotlin is a pragmatic replacement for Java that has perfect interoperability with the older language.  With it’s shallow learning curve, Kotlin can be easily added to an existing Java codebase and make use of the extensive universe of JVM libraries, just like Java.
