* **Session Title**: Here's What's Trending In Software Engineering
* **Preferred Timeframe**: Any weeknight
* **Event Type**: Lightning Talk (~30 minutes with questions)
* **Summary**: One of the great things about working in software engineering is all the new technology that pops up every day. So many new options are arriving on the open-source and commercial landscapes that give us levels of productivity, functionality, performance, and security we’ve never enjoyed before. Then again, constantly changing technology is also one of the intimidating things about working in software engineering. This talk will explore major trends in software engineering you should know so you can be prepared for what’s coming, and in some cases what’s already here, and evaluate how they can add value to your current projects.

* **Session Title**: Taming and Composing High Performance Stream-Oriented Processing
* **Preferred Timeframe**: Any weeknight
* **Event Type**: 50 mins / 1 hour Lecture
* **Summary**: Real time applications are dominating the industry! Data is the main ingredient in Internet-based, social media and Internet of things (IoT) systems, which generate continuous streams of events used for real time analytics. This poses a tremendous challenge due to the massive volume of data collected and processed. These event-based Real-time analysis systems can easily process millions of messages per second through new generation solutions by simply defining small flows and then combining them together to create processing graphs. In this talk, will cover the concepts behind high-performance streamed-oriented big data processing systems. We will explore messaging queue systems like Kafka and Akka Streams which let developers define their process workflows at a higher level to define a graph system enabling a high throughput. You will learn how to integrate high performance stream message queues and how to define process workflows in C# and F#.
