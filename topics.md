## Proposed Topic

* Session Title: Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul: How small teams can iterate on launching code for big projects
* Preferred Timeframe: Sometime before September 15th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: At NPR Digital Media we have chosen Jenkins CI as our in-house choice for launching code. While smaller projects lend themselves well to the Jenkins paradigm, large monolith repos do not. This talk is about how a small team of 30+ developers handle the stresses of launching something that millions depend on and our brand rests its laurels on. Focus will be on things we've tried, things we've failed at, and things we're still iterating.

### Painless End to End Testing with Cypress
*Scheduled June 27*

* Session Title: Painless end to end testing with Cypress
* Preferred Timeframe: March - June
* Event Type: 30/50-min Lecture
* Summary:   I recently went to Assert.JS where I saw a demo for Cypress.io. I couldn’t believe this tool existed and I had never heard about it. I immediately realized all of the things I always wanted in e2e testing had already been done, including things I didn’t know I wanted. I’ll demo what a cypress workflow looks like and show the cool tricks I’ve learned to make testing easy.

### Introduction to Microservice Architecture
*Scheduled July 25*

* Session Title: Introduction to Microservice Architecture
* Preferred Timeframe: June-July
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Cloud computing, containerization, and automation are becoming the norm for deploying digital solutions. These advancements have led some to rethink the traditional monolith architecture that has defined many areas of software development for so long. Because complicated and resource-intensive deployments are no longer a constraint microservice architectures are becoming popular among developers. Microservices are designed with a focus on scalability and clean code, but they come with a lot of questions. What do we do about shared functionality and cross-cutting concerns? How do we handle communication between microservices? How do we port our existing monolith application over to microservices? In this presentation I will answer these questions and more. I will discuss some common approaches to designing microservices along with the pros and cons of each. I will provide strategies for breaking up your business logic and technical concerns into reasonable services that are maintainable, replaceable, and independently deployable. And I will cover common pitfalls and gotchas that plague microservice designs. This presentation will contain some code samples, but I’ll do my best to keep them straight-forward enough that you won’t need knowledge of a particular programming language or tech stack to follow along.
