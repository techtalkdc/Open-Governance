## Proposed Topic

* Session Title: Describing JSON data with JSON Schema
* Preferred Timeframe: 10-15 minutes
* Event Type: Lightning Talk
* Summary: When people are talking about RESTful APIs, they usually think of resources and associated HTTP methods. But for me, data is in the heart of almost every API. JSON Schema is a precise description of JSON data which is both machine-readable and human-friendly. In this presentation, I will talk about how JSON schema is used to describe the structure of JSON data and provide an overview of my favorite features. By the end of this talk, you will know how to describe objects and their properties. In addition to this, you will also know how to model data type inheritance in JSON Schema.

* Session Title: You've Been a Bad Programmer Now Goto Your Room!: Composing Batch Files
* Preferred Timeframe: August or Otherwise
* Event Type: Lightning Talk
* Summary: In many batch files in the wild, there is little or no structure, leading to hard-to-read and sometimes scary-to-run scripts. By imposing just a few simple rules, a batch file can be transformed into a wonderful jewel of a script that can be simple to read, write and maintain. If you need or like to spend time at the command line, you might find this useful.

* Session Title: Giving Back with Open Source
* Preferred Timeframe: Any
* Event Type: Lightning Talk
* Summary: Here at the Case Foundation, we’ve released a few open source projects aimed at helping nonprofits, and I'd like to give a lightening talk on those projects and why we at the Case Foundation see open source as a philanthropic act whereby developers can support causes and issues they are passionate about via contributing code.

### Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul
*Scheduled August 29th* 

* Session Title: Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul: How small teams can iterate on launching code for big projects
* Preferred Timeframe: Sometime before September 15th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: At NPR Digital Media we have chosen Jenkins CI as our in-house choice for launching code. While smaller projects lend themselves well to the Jenkins paradigm, large monolith repos do not. This talk is about how a small team of 30+ developers handle the stresses of launching something that millions depend on and our brand rests its laurels on. Focus will be on things we've tried, things we've failed at, and things we're still iterating.
